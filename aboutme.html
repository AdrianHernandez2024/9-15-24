    <h1>About Adrian</h1>
</body> 
My name is Adrian Hernandez and I am currently a freshman at the University Of Rhode Island studying computer science.  I enjoy playing baseball, watching football, playing vieo games, and also have a strong intrest in coding.  One fun fact about me is that my father is from the Dominican Republic and I visit him every summer.
